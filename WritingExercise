Redis Cache
Redis cache is an open source and in-memory data storage space, which is used to cache the data for quick access. It saves snapshots of the dataset on the disk in a binary file. It supports master-slave replication policy, allowing multiple copies to be aynchronously maintained for the master server. This helps in prevention of data loss when master server goes down due to some failures. We can use redis in the more efficient way by make read queries on the slave servers while wrte and update queries on the master servers, in case the replication lag is not more than a few seconds.
Redis stores the data in the key-value format, with the maximum allowed key size is 512 MB. The values are accessed with the corresponding keys. It supports many complex data formats as keys and values rather than the standard String format like Sets, lists, etc.
It is very important to keep a check on the size of the data stored in the redis cache as it may exceed the cache size and start ignoring the incoming data, resulting in the data loss. To support this in the efficient way, it has a mechanism of timeout(Time-to-live), wherein the keys are expired after the timeout period. It also supports persistent data by setting the timeout period as -1.
The key-value structure of redis adds a disadvantage in using it, as it can be a big problem if one is dealing with inherently relational data. Its structure restricts from making complex search queries and limits it to making queries on the dataset's keys.
Typically, it can be used for applications where performance and flexibility are more critical than persistence and absolute data integrity.
